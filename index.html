              <summary>Who is this for? Could I be a Chief?</summary>
              <p>
                This community is built around early-stage generalists in roles such as Chief of
                Staff, Founders’ Associate and Entrepreneur in Residence. While we consider every
                profile carefully, we only accept applicants who are in these roles already or have
                made an impact in such a role recently.

              <summary>Where are Chiefs based?</summary>
              <p>
                Although, our community exists remotely in our Slack space, we truly value
                in-person interactions. This is why we meet up across our different hubs regularly
                and organise events. You will currently find most Chiefs based in and around Berlin,
                Munich and London. Please do not hesitate to join if your city is not currently
                represented. The number of hubs is constantly increasing!

              <p>
                Since there has been increasing interest in joining the community, we would like to
                ask you to be patient when waiting for feedback on your application. We are truly
                trying our best to revert as soon as possible.

              <summary>Does this cost anything?</summary>
              <p>Definitely not. We do not aim to be a members club.</p>

              <summary>Who is this run by?</summary>
              <p>
                This community is decentralised and primarily run by its own members. It was founded
                by Jannick, who was later joined by Damian. They manage applications and other
                high-level tasks. Both of them are (former) early-stage generalists and excited to
                build this community with the strong support of all Chiefs.
